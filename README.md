# FileSystemPractice
This is a very basic file management web page created by me using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have used firebase as database here. User can login in this webpage and create, save or delete files with different extension. I have also made a single file online code editor. I have plans to combine these to and create a multi file online code editor website.
